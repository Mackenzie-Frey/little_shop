# Little Shop


We have built an online e-commerce platform to sell local artisan goods. Our site allows users to add items to a cart and check out to purchase them from merchants. Merchants may log in to purchase items, add items to their own inventories, enable and disable items, fulfill orders, and edit existing items available. Admin users have access to change user status from merchants to regular users and vice versa, disable and enable users and merchants, have access to additional analytics, and cancel orders.
